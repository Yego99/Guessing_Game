# Guessing_Game
I created this guessing game as my initial project to assess my skills. To play, simply execute the program and input a number between 1 and 10 via the terminal to check if your guess is correct. The program loops through 3 if statements based on your response, and thanks to the try block, it won't error out. The game continues until you successfully guess the correct number.
